NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER FOR TUMOUR AS BENIGN AND MALIGNANT

Here we are going to solve Naive Bayes's classifier using supervised machine learning.

The problem here is of classifing the tumour classification as benign and malignant.

We are going to separate the dataset into three dataset namely as Traing dataset(70%), Cross Validation(20%) and the test dataset(10%).

Let us discussed the Bayes rule as P(A|B)= (P(B|A)*P(A)) / P(B) where LHS side is called the posterior probability and P(B|A) is known as the likelihood function and P(A) is known as prior probability and P(B) is called the Experience.

Let us calculate the Likelihood first :
          P(B|A)
					Separate the tumour dataset as the malignant and benign (Here suppose the out of 100000 dataset 70000 is the training data and             suppose 34000 are the benign tumour and rest are the malignant).
